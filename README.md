# Palingrams


Based on the book, Impractical Python Projects, currently loads a dictionary and finds all possible 2 word palingrams using words that are at least 2 letters long. 


# TODO

1.) Add the functionality to parse files so it can take any text document as input.<br/>
2.) Allow for phrases longer thanm 2 words to be found.<br/>
3.) Take user input for the file selected to check.<br/>
4.) Allow the ability to web scrawl so url's can also be taken as input.<br/>
